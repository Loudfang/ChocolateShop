This program was made for my mother who owned a small chocolate shop. She wanted a simple program to store the chocolates she 
had in a file that she could access later. Check what was in stock and add/delete as needed. The program also included 
a price converter, that would convert the weight of the chocolates to the price the client had to pay.
